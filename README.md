# FDTD3dCUDA

## About FDTD3d
The Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method is a rigorous and powerful tool for modeling nano-scale optical devices. FDTD solves Maxwell's equations directly without any physical approximation, and the maximum problem size is limited only by the extent of the computing power available.

## Introduction
